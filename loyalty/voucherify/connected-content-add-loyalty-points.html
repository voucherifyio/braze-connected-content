There are a couple of ways to trigger loyalty points. This approach gives the most flexibility to the marketing team.

Your marketing team can create an earning rule that will reward a customer after the customer is associated with an event. You can send the event when the message is sent.

Once the event is sent, depending on the definition of the earning rule, different customers can get a different number of points depending on their customer segment.
